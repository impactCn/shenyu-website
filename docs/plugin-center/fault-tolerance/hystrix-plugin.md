* Add `hystrix` dependency in the `pom.xml` file of the gateway.

```xml
        <!-- apache shenyu hystrix plugin start-->
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.apache.shenyu</groupId>
            <artifactId>shenyu-spring-boot-starter-plugin-hystrix</artifactId>
            <version>${project.version}</version>
        </dependency>
        <!-- apache shenyu hystrix plugin end-->
``` 



## Hystrix Config


For more information on selectors and rules configuration, see [Selector And Rule Config](../../user-guide/admin-usage/selector-and-rule) , only some of the fields are covered here.

#### Selector Config

It is used to filter traffic for the first time and does not require handle fields.

* Hystrix handler details:

  * Trip minimum request quantity: the minimum request quantity, which must be reached at least before the fuse is triggered
  * Error half-score threshold: the percentage of exceptions in this period of time.
  * Maximum concurrency: the maximum concurrency
  * Trip sleep time (ms): the recovery time after fusing.
  * Grouping Key: generally set as: contextPath
  * Command Key: generally set to specific path interface.
  * CallBackUrl: default url: /fallback/hystrix.

  * MinimumRequests: the minimum number of requests required to trigger a circuit breaker.

  * ErrorThresholdPercentage: percentage of exception occurring during that time.

  * MaxConcurrentRequests: max concurrent requests.

  * Sleep`(ms)`: The recovery time after the circuit breaker.

  * GroupKey: It is generally set to: `contextPath`.

  * CallBackUrl: default url `/fallback/hystrix`.

  * CommandKey: generally, it is set to a specific path interface.
