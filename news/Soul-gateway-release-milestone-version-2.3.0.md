It's half a year since the last release. In this half a year, our community friends and I have done too much. Completed nearly 200 PR, published nearly 300 articles of source code analysis, added more than 120 contributors, promoted 7 members of the commiter who  won the legitimate JetBrains. We have completed many, many functions  With their help. Thank you very much.

Admin is the control panel of the whole gateway, which is in charge of all traffic and rules matching.

- The Shiro framework is integrated into admin to complete the  permission control in user button level. 
- Templated plug-ins allow users to focus on data configuration without perceiving front-end pages.
- The internationalization of the whole backend of admin , supports switching between Chinese and English.

## Thanks

This is a milestone release and a formal change of Soul gateway. Our dashboard, code, documents, issue and PR are all internationalized in English, and the unit test coverage of the whole project has reached 70%.Thank you again for your hard work. Although we have completed a lot of functions (I did not fully list them above), we will have more challenges in the future. I believe that with you, this is not our end, but our starting point.
